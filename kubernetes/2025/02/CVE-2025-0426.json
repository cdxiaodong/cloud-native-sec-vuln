	"content_text": "CVSS Rating: [CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)\n\nA security issue was discovered in Kubernetes where a large number of container checkpoint requests made to the unauthenticated kubelet read-only HTTP endpoint may cause a Node Denial of Service by filling the Node's disk. \n\n### Am I vulnerable?\n\nAll clusters running an affected version listed below with the kubelet read-only HTTP port enabled and using a container runtime that supports the container checkpointing feature, such as CRI-O v1.25.0+ (with `enable_criu_support` set to true) or containerd v2.0+ with `criu` installed, are affected.\n\n#### Affected Versions\n\n- kubelet v1.32.0 to v1.32.1\n- kubelet v1.31.0 to v1.31.5\n- kubelet v1.30.0 to v1.30.9\n\n### How do I mitigate this vulnerability?\n\nThis issue can be mitigated by setting the `ContainerCheckpoint` feature gate to `false` in your kubelet configuration, disabling the kubelet read-only port, and limiting access to the kubelet API, or upgrading to a fixed version listed below, which enforces authentication for the kubelet Checkpoint API.\n\n#### Fixed Versions\n\n- kubelet master - fixed by #129739\n- kubelet v1.32.2 - fixed by #130010\n- kubelet v1.31.6 - fixed by #130011\n- kubelet v1.30.10 - fixed by #130012\n- kubelet v1.29.14 - fixed by #130014\n  - Note: Container checkpoint support was an off by default Alpha feature in v1.25-v1.29\n\n### Detection\n\nA large number of requests to the kubelet read-only HTTP server's `/checkpoint` endpoint, or a large number of checkpoints stored (by default) under `/var/lib/kubelet/checkpoints` on a Node may indicate an attempted Denial of Service attack using this bug.\n\nIf you find evidence that this vulnerability has been exploited, please contact security@kubernetes.io\n\n#### Acknowledgements\n\nThis vulnerability was reported and fixed by Tim Allclair @tallclair from Google.\n\nThe issue was coordinated by: \n\nTim Allclair @tallclair\nSascha Grunert saschagrunert@\nCraig Ingram @cji\nJordan Liggitt liggitt@\n\n/triage accepted\n/lifecycle frozen\n/area security\n/kind bug\n/committee security-response\n/label official-cve-feed\n/sig node\n/area kubelet",
