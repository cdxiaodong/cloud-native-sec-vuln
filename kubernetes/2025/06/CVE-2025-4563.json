	"content_text": "CVSS Rating:\n[CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3-1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L) - **Low** (2.7)\n\nA vulnerability exists in the NodeRestriction admission controller where nodes can bypass dynamic resource allocation authorization checks. When the DynamicResourceAllocation feature gate is enabled, the controller properly validates resource claim statuses during pod status updates but fails to perform equivalent validation during pod creation. This allows a compromised node to create mirror pods that access unauthorized dynamic resources, potentially leading to privilege escalation. In practice, sanity checks in the kubelet prevent starting those mirror pods after they have been created. Even if they were started, an attacker probably already has gained full access to the node and with most dynamic resources won’t be able to gain additional privileges.\n\n### Am I vulnerable?\n\nAll clusters that are using the DynamicResourceAllocation feature (disabled by default) and static pods together may be vulnerable.\n\n#### Affected Versions\n\nkube-apiserver: v1.32.0 - v1.32.5\nkube-apiserver: v1.33.0 - 1.33.1\n\n### How do I mitigate this vulnerability?\n\nThis issue can be mitigated by:\nIf you're not actively using the DynamicResourceAllocation features, the safest and simplest action is to turn off the feature on the API server.\n\n\n#### Fixed Versions\n\nkube-apiserver \u003e= v1.32.6 \nkube-apiserver \u003e= v1.33.2\n\n### Detection\n\nAll clusters that are using the DynamicResourceAllocation feature and static pods may be vulnerable.  Run the following command to see if the feature is in use:\n\n`kubectl get ResourceClaim --all-namespaces`\n\nand \n\n`kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o json | jq -r '\n  .items[] \n  | select(.metadata.annotations[\"kubernetes.io/config.mirror\"] == \"true\") \n  | \"\\(.metadata.namespace)/\\(.metadata.name)\"'`\n\nIf you find evidence that this vulnerability has been exploited, please contact security@kubernetes.io\n\n#### Acknowledgements\n\nThis vulnerability was reported by Amit Schendel @amitschendel ARMO\n\nThe issue was fixed and coordinated by: \n\nPatrick Ohly @pohly\nJordan Liggitt @liggitt\nBalaji @SaranBalaji90\nRita Zhang @ritazh\nMarko Mudrinić @xmudrii\n\n\n/triage accepted\n/lifecycle frozen",
