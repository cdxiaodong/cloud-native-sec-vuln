This can lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the ingress-nginx controller, and disclosure of Secrets accessible to the controller. (Note that in the default installation, the controller can access all Secrets cluster-wide.)\n\n### Am I vulnerable?\n\nThis issue affects ingress-nginx. If you do not have ingress-nginx installed on your cluster, you are not affected. You can check this by running \\`kubectl get pods \\--all-namespaces \\--selector app.kubernetes.io/name=ingress-nginx\\`.\n\n#### Affected Versions\n\n- \u003c v1.11.0\n- v1.11.0 \\- 1.11.4  \n- v1.12.0\n\n### How do I mitigate this vulnerability?\n\n**ACTION REQUIRED:** The following steps must be taken to mitigate this vulnerability: Upgrade ingress-nginx to v1.11.5, v1.12.1, or any later version.\n\n#### Fixed Versions\n\n- ingress-nginx [main@2e9f373](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pull/13068/commits/2e9f37380afb7853fa6daa1c3e6659550aadfd90)\n\nTo upgrade, refer to the documentation: [Upgrading Ingress-nginx](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/upgrade/)\n\n### Detection\n\nSuspicious data within the \\`mirror-target\\` or \\`mirror-host\\` annotations of an Ingress resource could indicate an attempt to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nIf you find evidence that this vulnerability has been exploited, please contact security@kubernetes.io\n\n#### Acknowledgements\n\nThis vulnerability was reported by Nir Ohfeld, Ronen Shustin, Sagi Tzadik and Hillai Ben Sasson from Wiz\n\nThe issue was fixed and coordinated by Marco Ebert, James Strong, Tabitha Sable, and the Kubernetes Security Response Committee\n",
