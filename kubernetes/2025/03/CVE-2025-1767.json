	"content_text": "**Issue Details**\nA security vulnerability was discovered in Kubernetes that could allow a user with create pod permission to exploit gitRepo volumes to access local git repositories belonging to other pods on the same node.\nThis issue has been rated Medium ([CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N)) (score: 6.5), and assigned CVE-2025-1767.\n\n**Am I vulnerable?**\n\nThis CVE only affects Kubernetes clusters that utilize the in-tree gitRepo volume to clone git repositories from other pods within the same node. Since the in-tree gitRepo volume feature has been deprecated and will not receive security updates upstream, any cluster still using this feature remains vulnerable. \nAffected Components\nkubelet\n\n**Affected Versions**\nAll versions of Kubernetes\n\n**How do I mitigate this vulnerability?**\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, you must use an init container to perform git clone operation and then mount the directory into the Pod's container. An example of this approach is provided [here](https://gist.github.com/tallclair/849601a16cebeee581ef2be50c351841).\n\nNote: You can also restrict the use of gitRepo volumes in your cluster using policies such as ValidatingAdmissionPolicy or through Restricted pod security standard policy. You can use the following Common Expression Language (CEL) expression as part of a policy to reject use of gitRepo volumes: `has(object.spec.volumes) || !object.spec.volumes.exists(v, has(v.gitRepo))`\n\n**Detection**\n\nTo detect whether this vulnerability has been exploited, you can use the following command to list all pods that use the in-tree gitRepo volume and clones to a .git subdirectory. \n`kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o json | jq '.items[] | select(.spec.volumes[].gitRepo.repository | test(\"^/\")) | {name: .metadata.name, namespace: .metadata.namespace, repository: (.spec.volumes[] | select(.gitRepo) | .gitRepo.repository)}'`\n\nIf you find evidence that this vulnerability has been exploited, please contact [security@kubernetes.io](mailto:security@kubernetes.io) \n\n**Acknowledgements**\nThis vulnerability was reported by Christophe Hauquiert.\n",
