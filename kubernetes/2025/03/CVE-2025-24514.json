	"content_text": "CVSS Rating: [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) (Score: 8.8, High)\n\nA security issue was discovered in [ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx) where the \\`auth-url\\` Ingress annotation can be used to inject configuration into nginx. This can lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the ingress-nginx controller, and disclosure of Secrets accessible to the controller. (Note that in the default installation, the controller can access all Secrets cluster-wide.)\n\n### Am I vulnerable?\n\nThis issue affects ingress-nginx. If you do not have ingress-nginx installed on your cluster, you are not affected. You can check this by running \\`kubectl get pods \\--all-namespaces \\--selector app.kubernetes.io/name=ingress-nginx\\`.\n\nThis issue does not affect you if you have the \\`enable-annotation-validation\\` CLI argument enabled. (This option is enabled by default starting from ingress-nginx v1.12.0.)\n\n#### Affected Versions\n\n- \u003c v1.11.0\n- v1.11.0 \\- 1.11.4  \n- v1.12.0\n\n### How do I mitigate this vulnerability?\n\n**ACTION REQUIRED:** The following steps must be taken to mitigate this vulnerability: Upgrade ingress-nginx to v1.11.5, v1.12.1, or any later version.\n\nPrior to upgrading, this vulnerability can be mitigated by setting the \\`enable-annotation-validation\\` CLI argument to “true”.\n\n#### Fixed Versions\n\n- ingress-nginx [main@ab470eb](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pull/13068/commits/ab470eb920924d62a197ebddd8a4cc3031a77ddf)\n\nTo upgrade, refer to the documentation: [Upgrading Ingress-nginx](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/upgrade/)\n\n### Detection\n\nSuspicious data within the \\`auth-url\\` annotation of an Ingress resource could indicate an attempt to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nIf you find evidence that this vulnerability has been exploited, please contact security@kubernetes.io\n\n#### Acknowledgements\n\nThis vulnerability was reported by Nir Ohfeld, Ronen Shustin and Sagi Tzadik from Wiz\n\nThe issue was fixed and coordinated by Marco Ebert, James Strong, Tabitha Sable, and the Kubernetes Security Response Committee\n",
