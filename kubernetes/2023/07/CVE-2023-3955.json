	"content_text": "CVSS Rating: [CVSS:3.1/av:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) - **HIGH** (8.8)\r\n\r\nA security issue was discovered in Kubernetes where a user that can create pods on Windows nodes may be able to escalate to admin privileges on those nodes. Kubernetes clusters are only affected if they include Windows nodes.\r\n\r\n### Am I vulnerable?\r\n\r\nAny kubernetes environment with Windows nodes is impacted.  Run `kubectl get nodes -l kubernetes.io/os=windows` to see if any Windows nodes are in use.\r\n\r\n#### Affected Versions\r\n\r\n- kubelet \u003c= v1.28.0\r\n- kubelet \u003c= v1.27.4\r\n- kubelet \u003c= v1.26.7\r\n- kubelet \u003c= v1.25.12\r\n- kubelet \u003c= v1.24.16\r\n\r\n### How do I mitigate this vulnerability?\r\n\r\nThe provided patch fully mitigates the vulnerability (see fix impact below).  Full mitigation for this class of issues requires patches applied for CVE-2023-3676, CVE-2023-3955, and CVE-2023-3893.\r\n\r\nOutside of applying the provided patch, there are no known mitigations to this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n#### Fixed Versions\r\n\r\n- kubelet master - fixed by #120128\r\n- kubelet v1.28.1 - fixed by #120134\r\n- kubelet v1.27.5 - fixed by #120135\r\n- kubelet v1.26.8 - fixed by #120136\r\n- kubelet v1.25.13 - fixed by #120137\r\n- kubelet v1.24.17 - fixed by #120138\r\n\r\n**Fix impact:** Passing Windows Powershell disk format options to in-tree volume plugins will result in an error during volume provisioning on the node.  There are no known use cases for this functionality, nor is this functionality supported by any known out-of-tree CSI driver.\r\n\r\nTo upgrade, refer to the documentation:\r\nhttps://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/cluster-upgrade/\r\n\r\n### Detection\r\n\r\nKubernetes audit logs can be used to detect if this vulnerability is being exploited. Pod create events with embedded powershell commands are a strong indication of exploitation.\r\n\r\nIf you find evidence that this vulnerability has been exploited, please contact security@kubernetes.io\r\n\r\n#### Acknowledgements\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability was discovered by James Sturtevant @jsturtevant and Mark Rossetti @marosset during the process of fixing CVE-2023-3676 (that original CVE was reported by Tomer Peled @tomerpeled92)\r\n\r\nThe issue was fixed and coordinated by the fix team: \r\n\r\nJames Sturtevant @jsturtevant\r\nMark Rossetti @marosset\r\nAndy Zhang @andyzhangx\r\nJustin Terry @jterry75\r\nKulwant Singh @KlwntSingh\r\nMicah Hausler @micahhausler\r\nRita Zhang @ritazh\r\n\r\nand release managers:\r\n\r\nJeremy Rickard @jeremyrickard",
