	"content_text": "CVSS Rating: [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) - **HIGH** (8.8)\r\n\r\nA security issue was discovered in Kubernetes where a user that can create pods on Windows nodes may be able to escalate to admin privileges on those nodes. Kubernetes clusters are only affected if they include Windows nodes.\r\n\r\n### Am I vulnerable?\r\n\r\nAny kubernetes environment with Windows nodes is impacted.  Run `kubectl get nodes -l kubernetes.io/os=windows` to see if any Windows nodes are in use.\r\n\r\n#### Affected Versions\r\n\r\n- kubelet \u003c= v1.28.0\r\n- kubelet \u003c= v1.27.4\r\n- kubelet \u003c= v1.26.7\r\n- kubelet \u003c= v1.25.12\r\n- kubelet \u003c= v1.24.16\r\n\r\n### How do I mitigate this vulnerability?\r\n\r\nThe provided patch fully mitigates the vulnerability and has no known side effects.  Full mitigation for this class of issues requires patches applied for CVE-2023-3676, CVE-2023-3955, and CVE-2023-3893.\r\n\r\nOutside of applying the provided patch, there are no known mitigations to this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n#### Fixed Versions\r\n\r\n- kubelet master - fixed by #120127\r\n- kubelet v1.28.1 - fixed by #120129\r\n- kubelet v1.27.5 - fixed by #120130\r\n- kubelet v1.26.8 - fixed by #120131\r\n- kubelet v1.25.13 - fixed by #120132\r\n- kubelet v1.24.17 - fixed by #120133\r\n\r\nTo upgrade, refer to the documentation:\r\nhttps://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/cluster-upgrade/\r\n\r\n### Detection\r\n\r\nKubernetes audit logs can be used to detect if this vulnerability is being exploited. Pod create events with embedded powershell commands are a strong indication of exploitation. Config maps and secrets that contain embedded powershell commands and are mounted into pods are also a strong indication of exploitation.\r\n\r\nIf you find evidence that this vulnerability has been exploited, please contact security@kubernetes.io\r\n\r\n#### Acknowledgements\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability was reported by Tomer Peled @tomerpeled92\r\n\r\nThe issue was fixed and coordinated by the fix team: \r\n\r\nJames Sturtevant @jsturtevant\r\nMark Rossetti @marosset\r\nAndy Zhang @andyzhangx\r\nJustin Terry @jterry75\r\nKulwant Singh @KlwntSingh\r\nMicah Hausler @micahhausler\r\nRita Zhang @ritazh\r\n\r\nand release managers:\r\n\r\nJeremy Rickard @jeremyrickard\r\n\r\n\r\n/triage accepted\r\n/lifecycle frozen\r\n/area security\r\n/kind bug\r\n/committee security-response",
