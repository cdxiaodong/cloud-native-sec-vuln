	"content_text": "### Issue Details\r\nA security issue was discovered in [ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx) where a user that can create or update ingress objects can use a newline character to bypass the sanitization of the `spec.rules[].http.paths[].path` field of an Ingress object (in the `networking.k8s.io` or `extensions` API group) to obtain the credentials of the ingress-nginx controller. In the default configuration, that credential has access to all secrets in the cluster.\r\n\r\nThis issue has been rated High ([CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L)), and assigned CVE-2021-25748.\r\n\r\n### Affected Components and Configurations\r\nThis bug affects ingress-nginx. If you do not have ingress-nginx installed on your cluster, you are not affected. You can check this by running `kubectl get po -n ingress-nginx`.\r\n\r\nIf you are running the “chrooted” ingress-nginx controller introduced in v1.2.0 (gcr.io/k8s-staging-ingress-nginx/controller-chroot), you are not affected.\r\n\r\nMultitenant environments where non-admin users have permissions to create Ingress objects are most affected by this issue.\r\n\r\n#### Affected Versions\r\n\u003cv1.2.1\r\n\r\n#### Fixed Versions\r\nv1.2.1\r\n\r\n### Mitigation\r\nIf you are unable to roll out the fix, this vulnerability can be mitigated by implementing an admission policy that restricts the `spec.rules[].http.paths[].path` field on the networking.k8s.io/Ingress resource to known safe characters (see the newly added [rules](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blame/main/internal/ingress/inspector/rules.go), or the suggested value for [annotation-value-word-blocklist](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/nginx-configuration/configmap/#annotation-value-word-blocklist)).\r\n\r\n### Detection\r\nIf you find evidence that this vulnerability has been exploited, please contact [security@kubernetes.io](mailto:security@kubernetes.io)\r\n\r\n### Additional Details\r\nSee ingress-nginx Issue [#8686](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/126814) for more details.\r\n\r\n### Acknowledgements\r\nThis vulnerability was reported by Gafnit Amiga.\r\n\r\nThank You,\r\nCJ Cullen on behalf of the Kubernetes Security Response Committee",
