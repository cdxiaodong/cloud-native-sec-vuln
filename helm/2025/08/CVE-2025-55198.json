	"summary": "Incorrect YAML Content Leads To Panic",
	"description": "A Helm contributor discovered an improper validation of type error when parsing Chart.yaml and index.yaml files that can lead to a panic.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nThere are two areas of YAML validation that were impacted. First, when a `Chart.yaml` file had a `null` maintainer or the `child` or `parent` of a dependencies `import-values` could be parsed as something other than a string, `helm lint` would panic. Second, when an `index.yaml` had an empty entry in the list of chart versions Helm would panic on interactions with that repository.\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\n\r\nThis issue has been resolved in Helm v3.18.5.\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\n\r\nEnsure YAML files are formatted as Helm expects prior to processing them with Helm.\r\n\r\n### References\r\n\r\nHelm's security policy is spelled out in detail in our [SECURITY](https://github.com/helm/community/blob/master/SECURITY.md) document.\r\n\r\n### Credits\r\n\r\nDisclosed by Jakub Ciolek at AlphaSense.",
