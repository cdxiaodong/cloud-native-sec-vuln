	"description": "The Helm core maintainers have identified a high severity security vulnerability in Go's `crypto` package affecting all versions prior to Helm 2.16.8 and Helm 3.1.0.\r\n\r\nThanks to @ravin9249 for identifying the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nOn 32-bit-architectures, Go before 1.12.16 and 1.13.x before 1.13.7 (and the `crypto/cryptobyte` package before 0.0.0-20200124225646-8b5121be2f68 for Go) allows attacks on clients resulting in a panic via a malformed X.509 certificate. This may allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service.\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\n\r\nA patch to compile Helm against Go 1.14.4 has been provided for Helm 2 and is available in Helm 2.16.8. Helm 3.1.0 and newer are compiled against Go 1.13.7+.\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability affects 32-bit architectures (like ARM and 386) due to an integer overflow, causing a panic and a Denial of Service (DoS). 64-bit architectures are not affected.\r\n\r\nIf you are on a 32-bit architecture, no workaround is available. Users are urged to upgrade to the latest version.\r\n\r\n### References\r\n\r\n- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-7919\r\n- https://github.com/golang/go/issues/36837\r\n- https://github.com/golang/go/commit/f938e06d0623d0e1de202575d16f1e126741f6e0\r\n- https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/8288\r\n\r\n### For more information\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\r\n\r\n* Open an issue in [the Helm repository](https://github.com/helm/helm/issues)\r\n* For security-specific issues, email us at \u003ccncf-helm-security@lists.cncf.io\u003e",
