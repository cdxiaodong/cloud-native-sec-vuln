	"description": "### Impact\r\n\r\nSecurity researchers at Trail of Bits discovered that plugin names are not sanitized properly. As a result, a malicious plugin author could use characters in a plugin name that would result in unexpected behavior, such as duplicating the name of another plugin or spoofing the output to `helm --help`.\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\n\r\nThis issue has been patched in Helm 3.3.2.\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\n\r\nDo not install untrusted Helm plugins. Examine the `name` field in the `plugin.yaml` file for a plugin, looking for characters outside of the [a-zA-Z0-9._-] range.\r\n",
