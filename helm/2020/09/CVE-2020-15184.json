	"description": "### Impact\r\n\r\nDuring a security audit of Helm's code base, security researchers at Trail of Bits identified a bug in which the `alias` field on a `Chart.yaml` is not properly sanitized. This could lead to the injection of unwanted information into a chart.\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\n\r\nThis issue has been patched in Helm 3.3.2 and 2.16.11\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\n\r\nManually review the `dependencies` field of any untrusted chart, verifying that the `alias` field is either not used, or (if used) does not contain newlines or path characters.\r\n",
