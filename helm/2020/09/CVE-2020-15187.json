	"description": "### Impact\r\n\r\nDuring a security audit of Helm's code base, Helm maintainers identified a bug in which a Helm plugin can contain duplicates of the same entry, with the last one always used. If a plugin is compromised, this lowers the level of access that an attacker needs to modify a plugin's install hooks, causing a local execution attack.\r\n\r\nTo perform this attack, an attacker must have write access to the git repository or plugin archive (.tgz) while being downloaded (which can occur during a MITM attack on a non-SSL connection).\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\n\r\nThis issue has been patched in Helm 2.16.11 and Helm 3.3.2.\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\n\r\nMake sure to install plugins using a secure connection protocol like SSL.",
