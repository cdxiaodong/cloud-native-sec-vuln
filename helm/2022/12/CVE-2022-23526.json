	"description": "Fuzz testing, by Ada Logics and sponsored by the CNCF, identified input to functions in the _chartutil_ package that can cause a segmentation violation. Applications that use functions from the _chartutil_ package in the Helm SDK can have a Denial of Service attack when they use this package and it panics.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nThe _chartutil_ package contains a parser that loads a JSON Schema validation file. For example, the Helm client when rendering a chart will validate its values with the schema file. The _chartutil_ package parses the schema file and loads it into structures Go can work with. Some schema files can cause array data structures to be created causing a memory violation.\r\n\r\nApplications that use the _chartutil_ package in the Helm SDK to parse a schema file can suffer a Denial of Service when that input causes a panic that cannot be recovered from.\r\n\r\nThe Helm Client will panic with a schema file that causes a memory violation panic. Helm is not a long running service so the panic will not affect future uses of the Helm client.\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\n\r\nThis issue has been resolved in 3.10.3. \r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\n\r\nSDK users can validate schema files that are correctly formatted before passing them to the _chartutil_ functions.\r\n\r\n### For more information\r\n\r\nHelm's security policy is spelled out in detail in our [SECURITY](https://github.com/helm/community/blob/master/SECURITY.md) document.\r\n\r\n### Credits\r\n\r\nDisclosed by Ada Logics in a fuzzing audit sponsored by CNCF.",
