	"description": "Fuzz testing, by Ada Logics and sponsored by the CNCF, identified input to functions in the _repo_ package that can cause a segmentation violation. Applications that use functions from the _repo_ package in the Helm SDK can have a Denial of Service attack when they use this package and it panics.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nThe _repo_ package contains a handler that processes the index file of a repository. For example, the Helm client adds references to chart repositories where charts are managed. The _repo_ package parses the index file of the repository and loads it into structures Go can work with. Some index files can cause array data structures to be created causing a memory violation.\r\n\r\nApplications that use the _repo_ package in the Helm SDK to parse an index file can suffer a Denial of Service when that input causes a panic that cannot be recovered from.\r\n\r\nThe Helm Client will panic with an index file that causes a memory violation panic. Helm is not a long running service so the panic will not affect future uses of the Helm client.\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\n\r\nThis issue has been resolved in 3.10.3. \r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\n\r\nSDK users can validate index files that are correctly formatted before passing them to the _repo_ functions.\r\n\r\n### For more information\r\n\r\nHelm's security policy is spelled out in detail in our [SECURITY](https://github.com/helm/community/blob/master/SECURITY.md) document.\r\n\r\n### Credits\r\n\r\nDisclosed by Ada Logics in a fuzzing audit sponsored by CNCF.",
