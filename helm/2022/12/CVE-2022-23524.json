	"description": "Fuzz testing, by Ada Logics and sponsored by the CNCF, identified input to functions in the _strvals_ package that can cause a stack overflow. In Go, a stack overflow cannot be recovered from. Applications that use functions from the _strvals_ package in the Helm SDK can have a Denial of Service attack when they use this package and it panics.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nThe _strvals_ package contains a parser that turns strings into Go structures. For example, the Helm client has command line flags like `--set`, `--set-string`, and others that enable the user to pass in strings that are merged into the values. The _strvals_ package converts these strings into structures Go can work with. Some string inputs can cause array data structures to be created causing a stack overflow.\r\n\r\nApplications that use the _strvals_ package in the Helm SDK to parse user supplied input can suffer a Denial of Service when that input causes a panic that cannot be recovered from.\r\n\r\nThe Helm Client will panic with input to `--set`, `--set-string`, and other value setting flags that causes a stack overflow. Helm is not a long running service so the panic will not affect future uses of the Helm client.\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\n\r\nThis issue has been resolved in 3.10.3. \r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\n\r\nSDK users can validate strings supplied by users won't create large arrays causing significant memory usage before passing them to the _strvals_ functions.\r\n\r\n### For more information\r\n\r\nHelm's security policy is spelled out in detail in our [SECURITY](https://github.com/helm/community/blob/master/SECURITY.md) document.\r\n\r\n### Credits\r\n\r\nDisclosed by Ada Logics in a fuzzing audit sponsored by CNCF.",
