	"description": "### Impact\r\nFour vulnerabilities were discovered in Envoy that may impact the ability to forward HTTP requests and responses. Cilium uses Envoy to apply L7 policies for HTTP and derived protocols such as gRPC. \r\n\r\nAll vulnerabilities are forms of Denial of Service (DoS) in the Envoy binary which causes excess resource consumption. This relates to the availability of the Envoy instance, which could cause increased node memory usage and impact on traffic forwarding for traffic selected by an L7 policy.\r\n\r\n### Affected versions\r\nUsers who operate Cilium with HTTP policies may be affected. Users who operate Cilium with no L7 policies or L7 policies with DNS (but not with HTTP) are not affected.\r\n\r\n - **Cilium 1.8.0**\r\n - **Cilium 1.7.5 and earlier**\r\n - **Cilium 1.6.9 and earlier**\r\n - **Cilium [istio_proxy](https://hub.docker.com/r/cilium/istio_proxy/tags) 1.5.6 and earlier**\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\nCilium has been updated to use Envoy 1.13.3 which includes the upstream security fixes. The following Cilium versions have been released with these fixes:\r\n\r\n - [v1.8.1](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/releases/tag/1.8.1)\r\n - [v1.7.6](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/releases/tag/1.7.6)\r\n - [v1.6.10](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/releases/tag/1.6.10)\r\n\r\nThe following Cilium Istio proxy images have been released with these fixes:\r\n - [v1.5.7](https://github.com/cilium/istio/releases/tag/1.5.7)\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\nThere is no known fix or remediation to the vulnerabilities without upgrading.\r\n\r\n### References\r\n - [CVE-2020-8663](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8663)\r\n - [CVE-2020-12605](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-12605)\r\n - [CVE-2020-12604](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-12604)\r\n - [CVE-2020-12603](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-12603)\r\n - [Envoy 1.13.3 release notes](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/version_history/v1.13.3)\r\n - [Istio 1.5.7 release notes](https://istio.io/latest/news/releases/1.5.x/announcing-1.5.7/)\r\n\r\n### For more information\r\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\r\n* Open an issue in [Cilium Issues](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/issues)\r\n* Email us at [security@cilium.io](mailto:security@cilium.io)\r\n",
