	"description": "### Impact\r\n\r\nThe output of `cilium-bugtool` can contain sensitive data when the tool is run (with the `--envoy-dump` flag set) against Cilium deployments with the Envoy proxy enabled.\r\n\r\nUsers of the following features are affected:\r\n\r\n- [TLS inspection](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/tls-visibility/#gs-tls-inspection)\r\n- [Ingress with TLS termination](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/network/servicemesh/tls-termination/#gs-ingress-tls)\r\n- [Gateway API with TLS termination](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/network/servicemesh/gateway-api/https/)\r\n- [Kafka network policies with API key filtering](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/policy/language/#kafka-beta)\r\n\r\nThe sensitive data includes:\r\n\r\n- The CA certificate, certificate chain, and private key used by Cilium HTTP Network Policies, and when using Ingress/Gateway API\r\n- The API keys used in Kafka-related network policy\r\n\r\n`cilium-bugtool` is a debugging tool that is typically invoked manually and does not run during the normal operation of a Cilium cluster.\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\n\r\nThis issue affects:\r\n\r\n- Cilium v1.13 between v1.13.0 and v1.13.16 inclusive\r\n- Cilium v1.14 between v1.14.0 and v1.14.11 inclusive\r\n- Cilium v1.15 between v1.15.0 and v1.15.5 inclusive\r\n\r\nThis issue has been patched in:\r\n\r\n- Cilium v1.15.6\r\n- Cilium v1.14.12\r\n- Cilium v1.13.17\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\n\r\nThere is no workaround to this issue.\r\n\r\n### Acknowledgements\r\n\r\nThe Cilium community has worked together with members of Isovalent to prepare these mitigations. Special thanks to @sayboras for their work on triaging and remediating this issue.\r\n\r\n### For more information\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please reach out on [Slack](https://docs.cilium.io/en/latest/community/community/#slack).\r\n\r\nIf you think you have found a vulnerability affecting Cilium, we strongly encourage you to report it to our security mailing list at [security@cilium.io](mailto:security@cilium.io). This is a private mailing list for the Cilium security team, and your report will be treated as top priority.",
