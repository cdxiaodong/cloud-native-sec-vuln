	"summary": "Policy bypass for Host Firewall policy due to race condition in Cilium agent",
	"description": "### Impact\r\n\r\nA race condition in the Cilium agent can cause the agent to ignore labels that should be applied to a node. This could in turn cause CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicies intended for nodes with the ignored label to not apply, leading to policy bypass.\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\n\r\nThis issue was fixed in https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/33511.\r\n\r\nThis issue affects:\r\n\r\n- All versions of Cilium before v1.14.14\r\n- Cilium v1.15 between v1.15.0 and v1.15.7 inclusive\r\n\r\nThis issue has been patched in:\r\n\r\n- Cilium v1.14.14\r\n- Cilium v1.15.8\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\n\r\nAs the underlying issue depends on a race condition, users unable to upgrade can restart the Cilium agent on affected nodes until the affected policies are confirmed to be working as expected.\r\n\r\n### Acknowledgements\r\n\r\nThe Cilium community has worked together with members of Google and Isovalent to prepare these mitigations. Special thanks to @skmatti for raising and resolving this issue.\r\n\r\n### For more information\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please reach out on [Slack](https://docs.cilium.io/en/latest/community/community/#slack).\r\n\r\nIf you think you have found a vulnerability affecting Cilium, we strongly encourage you to report it to our security mailing list at [security@cilium.io](mailto:security@cilium.io). This is a private mailing list for the Cilium security team, and your report will be treated as top priority.\r\n",
