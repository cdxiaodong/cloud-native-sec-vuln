	"description": "### Impact\r\n\r\n[Node based network policies](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/policy/language/#node-based) (`fromNodes` and `toNodes`) will incorrectly permit traffic to/from non-node endpoints that share the labels specified in `fromNodes` and `toNodes` sections of network policies. Node based network policy is disabled by default in Cilium.\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\n\r\nThis issue was fixed by https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/36657.\r\n\r\nThis issue affects:\r\n\r\n- Cilium v1.16 between v1.16.0 and v1.16.7 inclusive\r\n- Cilium v1.17 between v1.17.0 and v1.17.1 inclusive\r\n\r\nThis issue is fixed in:\r\n\r\n- Cilium v1.16.8\r\n- Cilium v1.17.2\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\n\r\nUsers can work around this issue by ensuring that the labels used in `fromNodes` and `toNodes` fields are used exclusively by nodes and not by other endpoints.\r\n\r\n### Acknowledgements\r\n\r\nThe Cilium community has worked together with members of Isovalent to prepare these mitigations. Special thanks to @oblazek  for reporting and fixing this issue.\r\n\r\n### For more information\r\n\r\nIf you think you have found a vulnerability affecting Cilium, we strongly encourage you to report it to our security mailing list at [security@cilium.io](mailto:security@cilium.io). This is a private mailing list for the Cilium security team, and your report will be treated as top priority. Please also address any comments or questions on this advisory to the same mailing list.\r\n",
