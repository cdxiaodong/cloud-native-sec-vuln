	"description": "### Impact\r\n\r\nWhen using [Wireguard transparent encryption](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/network/encryption-wireguard/#encryption-wg) in a Cilium cluster, packets that originate from a terminating endpoint can leave the source node without encryption due to a race condition in how traffic is processed by Cilium.\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\n\r\nThis issue has been patched in https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/38592.\r\n\r\nThis issue affects:\r\n\r\n- Cilium v1.15 between v1.15.0 and v1.15.15 inclusive\r\n- Cilium v1.16 between v1.16.0 and v1.16.8 inclusive\r\n- Cilium v1.17 between v1.17.0 and v1.17.2 inclusive\r\n\r\nThis issue is fixed in:\r\n\r\n- Cilium v1.15.16\r\n- Cilium v1.16.9\r\n- Cilium v1.17.3\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\n\r\nThere is no workaround to this issue.\r\n\r\n### Acknowledgements\r\n\r\nThe Cilium community has worked together with members of Isovalent to prepare these mitigations. Special thanks to @gandro  and @pippolo84 for reporting this issue and to @julianwiedmann for the patch.\r\n\r\n### For more information\r\n\r\nIf you think you have found a vulnerability affecting Cilium, we strongly encourage you to report it to our security mailing list at [security@cilium.io](mailto:security@cilium.io). This is a private mailing list for the Cilium security team, and your report will be treated as top priority.\r\n",
