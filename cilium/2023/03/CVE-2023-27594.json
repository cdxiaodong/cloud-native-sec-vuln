	"summary": "Potential network policy bypass when routing IPv6 traffic ",
	"description": "## Impact\r\n\r\nUnder specific conditions, Cilium may misattribute the source IP address of traffic to a cluster, identifying external traffic as coming from the host on which Cilium is running. As a consequence, network policies for that cluster might be bypassed, depending on the specific network policies enabled. Only IPv6 traffic is impacted by this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis issue only manifests when:\r\n* Cilium is routing IPv6 traffic, and\r\n* Kube-proxy is used for service handling, and\r\n* NodePorts are used to route traffic to pods.\r\n\r\nIPv6 is disabled by default. Cilium's kube-proxy replacement feature is not affected by this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n## Patches\r\n\r\nThe problem has been fixed and is available on versions \u003e=1.11.15, \u003e=1.12.8, \u003e=1.13.1\r\n\r\n## Workarounds\r\n\r\nDisable IPv6 routing (IPv6 is disabled by default).\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgements\r\n\r\nThe Cilium community has worked together with members of Isovalent to prepare these mitigations. Special thanks to Yusuke Suzuki for both highlighting and fixing the issue.\r\n\r\n## For more information\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please reach out on [Slack](https://docs.cilium.io/en/latest/community/community/#slack).\r\n\r\nAs usual, if you think you found a related vulnerability, we strongly encourage you to report security vulnerabilities to our private security mailing list: security@cilium.io - first, before disclosing them in any public forums. This is a private mailing list where only members of the Cilium internal security team are subscribed to, and is treated as top priority.",
