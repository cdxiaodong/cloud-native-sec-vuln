	"description": "### Impact\r\nA bug was found in containerd where containers launched with a User set as a `UID:GID` larger than the maximum 32-bit signed integer can cause an overflow condition where the container ultimately runs as root (UID 0). This could cause unexpected behavior for environments that require containers to run as a non-root user.\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\nThis bug has been fixed in the following containerd versions: \r\n\r\n* 2.0.4 (Fixed in https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/1a43cb6a1035441f9aca8f5666a9b3ef9e70ab20)\r\n* 1.7.27 (Fixed in https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/05044ec0a9a75232cad458027ca83437aae3f4da)\r\n* 1.6.38 (Fixed in https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/cf158e884cfe4812a6c371b59e4ea9bc4c46e51a)\r\n\r\nUsers should update to these versions to resolve the issue.\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\nEnsure that only trusted images are used and that only trusted users have permissions to import images.\r\n\r\n### Credits\r\nThe containerd project would like to thank [Benjamin Koltermann](https://github.com/p4ck3t0) and [emxll](https://github.com/emxll) for responsibly disclosing this issue in accordance with the [containerd security policy](https://github.com/containerd/project/blob/main/SECURITY.md).\r\n\r\n### References\r\n* https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-40635\r\n\r\n### For more information\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\r\n\r\n* Open an issue in [containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/new/choose)\r\n* Email us at [security@containerd.io](mailto:security@containerd.io)\r\n\r\nTo report a security issue in containerd:\r\n* [Report a new vulnerability](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/security/advisories/new)\r\n* Email us at [security@containerd.io](mailto:security@containerd.io)",
