	"summary": "containerd CRI plugin: Host memory exhaustion through ExecSync",
	"description": "### Impact\r\n\r\nA bug was found in containerd's CRI implementation where programs inside a container can cause the containerd daemon to consume memory without bound during invocation of the `ExecSync` API.  This can cause containerd to consume all available memory on the computer, denying service to other legitimate workloads.  Kubernetes and crictl can both be configured to use containerd's CRI implementation; `ExecSync` may be used when running probes or when executing processes via an \"exec\" facility.\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\n\r\nThis bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.6 and 1.5.13.  Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue.\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\n\r\nEnsure that only trusted images and commands are used. \r\n\r\n### References\r\n\r\n* Similar fix in cri-o's CRI implementation https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/security/advisories/GHSA-fcm2-6c3h-pg6j\r\n\r\n### Credits\r\n\r\nThe containerd project would like to thank David Korczynski and Adam Korczynski of ADA Logics for responsibly disclosing this issue in accordance with the [containerd security policy](https://github.com/containerd/project/blob/main/SECURITY.md) during a security audit sponsored by CNCF and facilitated by OSTIF.\r\n\r\n### For more information\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\r\n\r\n* Open an issue in [containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/new/choose)\r\n* Email us at [security@containerd.io](mailto:security@containerd.io)",
