A maliciously crafted image with a large file where a limit was not applied could cause a denial of service.\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\n\r\nThis bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.18 and 1.5.18.  Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue.\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\n\r\nEnsure that only trusted images are used and that only trusted users have permissions to import images. \r\n\r\n### Credits\r\n\r\nThe containerd project would like to thank [David Korczynski](https://github.com/DavidKorczynski) and [Adam Korczynski](https://github.com/AdamKorcz) of ADA Logics for responsibly disclosing this issue in accordance with the [containerd security policy](https://github.com/containerd/project/blob/main/SECURITY.md) during a security fuzzing audit sponsored by CNCF.\r\n\r\n### For more information\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\r\n\r\n* Open an issue in [containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/new/choose)\r\n* Email us at [security@containerd.io](mailto:security@containerd.io)\r\n\r\nTo report a security issue in containerd:\r\n* [Report a new vulnerability](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/security/advisories/new)\r\n* Email us at [security@containerd.io](mailto:security@containerd.io)",
