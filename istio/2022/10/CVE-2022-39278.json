	"description": "**Impact**\r\n\r\nThe Istio control plane, istiod, is vulnerable to a request processing error, allowing a malicious attacker that sends a specially crafted or oversized message which results in the control plane crashing when the Kubernetes validating or mutating webhook service is exposed publicly. This endpoint is served over TLS port 15017, but does not require any authentication from the attacker.\r\n\r\nFor simple installations, Istiod is typically only reachable from within the cluster, limiting the blast radius. However, for some deployments, especially [external istiod](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/install/external-controlplane/) topologies, this port is exposed over the public internet.\r\n\r\n**Patches**\r\n1.15.2\r\n1.14.5\r\n1.13.9\r\n\r\n**Workarounds**\r\nThere are no effective workarounds, beyond upgrading. This bug is due to an error in regexp.Compile in Go.\r\n\r\n**References**\r\nMore details can be found in the [Istio Security Bulletin](https://istio.io/latest/news/security/istio-security-2022-003)\r\n\r\n**For more information**\r\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please email us at [istio-security-vulnerability-reports@googlegroups.com](mailto:istio-security-vulnerability-reports@googlegroups.com)",
