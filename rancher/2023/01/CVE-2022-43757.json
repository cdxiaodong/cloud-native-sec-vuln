	"description": "### Impact\r\n\r\nThis issue affects Rancher versions from 2.5.0 up to and including 2.5.16, from 2.6.0 up to and including 2.6.9 and 2.7.0. It was discovered that the security advisory CVE-2021-36782 (GHSA-g7j7-h4q8-8w2f), previously released by Rancher, missed addressing some sensitive fields, secret tokens, encryption keys, and SSH keys that were still being stored in plaintext directly on Kubernetes objects like `Clusters`.\r\n\r\nThe exposed credentials are visible in Rancher to authenticated `Cluster Owners`, `Cluster Members`, `Project Owners` and `Project Members` of that cluster on the endpoints:\r\n\r\n- `/v1/management.cattle.io.cluster`\r\n- `/v1/management.cattle.io.clustertemplaterevisions`\r\n\r\nThe remaining sensitive fields are now stripped from `Clusters` and other objects and moved to a `Secret` before the object is stored. The `Secret` is retrieved when the credential is needed. For objects that existed before this security fix, a one-time migration happens on startup.\r\n\r\nThe fields that have been addressed by this security fix are:\r\n\r\n- `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.Services.KubeAPI.SecretsEncryptionConfig.CustomConfig.Providers[].AESGCM.Keys[].Secret`\r\n- `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.Services.KubeAPI.SecretsEncryptionConfig.CustomConfig.Providers[].AESCBC.Keys[].Secret`\r\n- `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.Services.KubeAPI.SecretsEncryptionConfig.CustomConfig.Providers[].SecretboxConfiguration.Keys[].Secret`\r\n- `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.Services.Kubelet.ExtraEnv` when containing the `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variable\r\n- `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.BastionHost.SSHKey`\r\n- `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.PrivateRegistries[].ECRCredentialPlugin.AwsSecretAccessKey`\r\n- `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.PrivateRegistries[].ECRCredentialPlugin.AwsSessionToken`\r\n- `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.Network.AciNetworkProvider.ApicUserKey`\r\n- `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.Network.AciNetworkProvider.KafkaClientKey`\r\n- `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.Network.AciNetworkProvider.Token`\r\n\r\n**Important:**\r\n\r\n- For the exposure of credentials not related to Rancher, the final impact severity for confidentiality, integrity and availability is dependent on the permissions the leaked credentials have on their services.\r\n\r\n- It is recommended to review for potentially leaked credentials in this scenario and to change them if deemed necessary.\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\n\r\nThere is no direct mitigation besides updating Rancher to a patched version.\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\n\r\nPatched versions include releases 2.5.17, 2.6.10, 2.7.1 and later versions.\r\n\r\nAfter upgrading to a patched version, it is important to check for the `ACISecretsMigrated` and `RKESecretsMigrated` conditions on `Clusters` and `ClusterTemplateRevisions` to confirm when secrets have been fully migrated off of those objects, and the objects scoped within them.\r\n\r\n### For more information\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\r\n\r\n* Reach out to [SUSE Rancher Security team](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/policy) for security related inquiries.\r\n* Open an issue in [Rancher](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/new/choose) repository.\r\n* Verify our [support matrix](https://www.suse.com/suse-rancher/support-matrix/all-supported-versions/) and [product support lifecycle](https://www.suse.com/lifecycle/).",
